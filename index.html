                    <p>Maintained and developed endpoints, handlers and controllers in .NET based on the requirements of the business, and performed E2E and unit testing on these changes to ensure effectiveness of the applications accuracy and expected results. 
                        Handled exceptions of real time transaction threads in Java and worked on multiple Java projects to update code functionalities ensuring the smooth transfer of transactions through the databases through and from the federal VAC department. 
                        Produced automated unit tests for .NET endpoints in technical debt sprints, ensuring a good test coverage for most of the VAC applications. 
                        Created Java builds in TeamCity using powershell scripts making the build runs more efficient and less taxing. As well, reviewed and built systems in preparations for code deployment, ensuring code is working correctly before deployment. 
                        Provided the department a technical report investigating the utilization of AI in automated testing in comparison with the testing pyramid. The methodologies presented and researched are in the process of being implemented in many teams.
